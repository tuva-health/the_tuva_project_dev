    description: > 
      This model creates one record per patient per condition using the tuva 
      chronic conditions hierarchy as the grouper. The model pulls in the first 
      and last date of the diagnosis that flagged the patient for this condition 
      group.

      This model creates one record per patient with flags for all the

      a 1 in the column for a certain condition if they have every been coded 
      with a diagnosis that rolls up to that condition and a 0 if not.
