-- *************************************************
-- This dbt model groups acute inpatient institutional
-- claims into encounters. It assigns an encounter_id
-- to each acute inpatient institutional claim.
-- This returns a table with 3 fields:
--      patient_id
--      claim_id
--      encounter_id
-- The number of rows in the table should be equal
-- to the number of acute inpatient institutional claims.
