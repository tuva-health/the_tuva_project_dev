Steps for transforming eligibility data into member demographics:
    1) Determine enrollment status using eligibility from the collection year.
    2) Roll up to latest eligibility record.
    3) Add age groups based on the payment year.
    4) Determine other statuses.

Jinja is used to set payment and collection year variables.
 - The hcc_model_version and payment_year vars have been set here
   so they get compiled.
 - CMS guidance: Age is calculated as of Feb 1 of the payment year.
 - The collection year is one year prior to the payment year.
